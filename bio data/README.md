## Dataset Preprocess details

For the biomedical and clinical data, each `.txt` file was converted into a `.csv`. 

```bash
python preprocess.py
```

The biomedical dataframes were then concatenated with the clinical dataframes in `biomed_data_preparation.ipynb`, yielding a size = (234454, 272) dataframe called `biomedical_clinical_data.csv`.
